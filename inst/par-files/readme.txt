This folder contains par-files generated by MACRO In FOCUS.

Some of the par-files in this folder have been manually edited 
so that the RUNID, OUTPUTFILE, DRIVINGPERIOD and 
"Output File =" (in the 
information section) matches those generated by macrounchained 
when running the tests and that are compared with the 
par-files in this folder.

For the same reason, the ID of the layered output variables 
such as in the row immediately following WOUT, WFLOWOUT, 
SFLOW and SFLOWOUT have been changed to match the default ID 
of these output as created by macrounchained. It is assumed 
here that these IDs are in fact unnecessary for the simulation.
