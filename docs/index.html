<p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/" title="The R Project for Statistical Computing">R</a> package for <strong>batch simulation of substance properties and application patterns</strong> with <a href="https://www.slu.se/en/Collaborative-Centres-and-Projects/centre-for-chemical-pesticides-ckb1/models/macro-52/" title="MACRO 5.2 (SLU/CKB)">MACRO</a>, a model of water flow and solute transport in macroporous soil, or its regulatory variant <a href="https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/macro" title="MACRO In FOCUS (FOCUS DG SANTE)">MACRO In FOCUS</a>, including simulation of <strong>Nth-order metabolites</strong>. The substance properties and application patterns that can be modified are currently those relevant for the groundwater scenario of MACRO In FOCUS.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Development status</strong>: pre-release. Do not use for production purpose, as the interface may still evolve if needed, and some bugs may I come unnoticed despite all the tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General information</strong>: See <a href="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a> (including author(s), package-version, minimum R version required, …).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change log</strong>: See <a href="NEWS">NEWS</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: <code>macrounchained</code> will only work on Windows, because MACRO is a Windows-only program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>License</strong>: MIT License. See <a href="LICENSE">LICENSE</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Either MACRO or MACRO In FOCUS or both need to be installed for using <code>macrounchained</code> (see below).</p>
<div id="features" class="section level1">
<div class="page-header"><h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#features" class="anchor"></a>Features</h1></div>
<ul>
<li><p>MACRO In FOCUS groundwater users just need to use one R command, <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW_ui.html">macrounchained::macrounchainedFocusGW_ui()</a></code>. The command starts a text user interface that allows the users to obtain a copy of example Excel-files for the input-parameters, or to run MACRO In FOCUS simulations after importing input parameters from an Excel-file they have prepared. It is possible to include multiple scenario, crops and substance parameters sets (with or without metabolites). It is also possible to simulate several applications per year and applications every other or every third year. The scenario currently included as Châteaudun, the three Swedish scenario (Näsbygård, Önnestad and Krusenberg), and the two Norwegian scenario (Heia and Rustad).</p></li>
<li><p>MACRO users need in the first place to export a template <code>.par</code>-file (a text file containing the parameters for a MACRO simulation) from MACRO, and will use that template as an input for <code>macrounchained</code> to modify the substance properties and application patterns (doses and application dates). All other parameters such as those concerting the soil properties, the climate, the crop or the number of applications cannot be modified by <code>macrounchained</code>. MACRO users may just use <code>macrounchained</code> to run MACRO simulations and analyse the results separately, or use their own R functions to analyse and summarise simulation results ‘on the fly’. An example for MACRO 5.2 is available here <a href="https://github.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained/blob/master/inst/more_tests/test_GW_09_macro.r" class="uri">https://github.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained/blob/master/inst/more_tests/test_GW_09_macro.r</a></p></li>
<li><p>Several sets of substance properties can be simulated in the same batch (up to 998 sets per batch). The sets of substance properties don’t need to be related.</p></li>
<li><p>For MACRO users, several <code>.par</code>-file templates can be used in the same batch of simulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nth-order metabolites</strong> can be simulated (only limited by the total number of simulations) and several degradation products can be simulated for the same parent substance (also limited by the total number of simulations), in the same batch. It is nonetheless not possible to simulate degradation products originating from several parent substances. The so called ‘intermediate simulations’ are handled automatically by the package.</p></li>
<li><p>Two higher order functions are provided: <code><a href="reference/macrounchained-methods.html">macrounchained()</a></code> and <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code>. The first is a generic functions, the workhorse of this package, while the second is designed for MACRO In FOCUS groundwater simulations. <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW_ui.html">macrounchained::macrounchainedFocusGW_ui()</a></code> is a simple text interface for <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> analyses on-the-fly the simulation results and provides the user with a summary of the results, in a similar fashion as fashion as standard <strong>MACRO In FOCUS groundwater</strong> simulations. .</p></li>
<li><p>Currently only tested on <strong>MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The results of <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> have been successfully tested against the results of the “version control” of MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4, and give the same PECgw for all the simulations included in the version control. The function has also been successfully tested against the results of MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4 for other cases (two application per year; two years interval between applications; Swedish and Norwegian scemario). The tests are “build-in” the package, and they can be run each time an important change is made to the package. The test results can be checked here: <a href="https://github.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained/tree/master/inst/more_tests" class="uri">https://github.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained/tree/master/inst/more_tests</a></p></li>
<li><p>As the interface of MACRO In FOCUS only allow the parametrization of 1st-order metabolites, the package has only been tested for 1st-order metabolites. Results of 2nd-order metabolites have not been compared with a reference value, because of the lack of a public benchmark.</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="reference/macrounchained-methods.html">macrounchained()</a></code> and <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> output an operation log informing the users of the operations being performed. <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> also output a summary of the simulation results (including the PECgw) in the operation log, as well as in separate files.</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="reference/macrounchained-methods.html">macrounchained()</a></code> and <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> produce a <code>tar.gz</code> archive containing all the relevant input and output files of the simulation batch. This can be used as an archive by the user.</p></li>
<li><p>The packages do not include any MACRO executable, and instead use an existing MACRO or MACRO In FOCUS installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Extensive traceability, with MACRO-version, packages-versions and revision (i.e. a machine generated code linking the package to the code version control system), but also with MD5 checksum for the packages and MACRO-files, reported to the user, so that it is in principle possible to check if a simulation was performed with an official release of the packages or of the MACRO executable, or not.</p></li>

<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#installation" class="anchor"></a>Installation</h1>
<p>End-users should manually install the package from Windows binary package (a <code>.zip</code>-archive). The binary package provided on the website indicated below are presumably stable versions of the package, for release or pre-release (see status above).</p>
<p>Experienced users and developers may prefer to install the development version of the package, from <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub development platform">GitHub</a>. The later should not be seen as a stable version and may not work at all.</p>
<p>Before you install the package, check in the <a href="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a>-file what is the minimum version of R needed to run this package (field “Depends”, see “R (&gt;= …)”). For convenience, the minimum R version required has been set to R &gt;= 3.1, so that user with an old version of R may still try to install and use the package. The package has nonetheless not been tested on that version, but instead on R 3.5.1 (at the time of writing this text). Some problems may therefore occur on older versions.</p>
<p>If needed, the code can be loaded as an R-script instead of installed as a package (see below), and used on any R-version presumably compatible with the code.</p>
<div id="installing-the-package-from-windows-binaries" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#installing-the-package-from-windows-binaries" class="anchor"></a>Installing the package from Windows binaries</h2>
<p>Windows binary-installer (a <code>.zip</code> file) and source tar of the package (a <code>.tar.gz</code> file) can be downloaded from the following address: <a href="https://rpackages.julienmoeys.info/macrounchained/" class="uri">https://rpackages.julienmoeys.info/macrounchained/</a></p>
<p>Choose both the binary-installer for <code>macrounchained</code>, <code>rmacrolite</code>, <code>macroutils2</code> and <code>codeinfo</code>.</p>
<p>Save the files to a local folder on your computer.</p>
<p>As I cannot guarantee the integrity of the website above, it is recommended to scan the file(s) with an antivirus, not least if you work in a corporation or a public institution.</p>
<p>Do not unpack the <code>.zip</code> archive (nor the <code>.tar.gz</code> archive) before installing the package.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Windows-packages" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Windows-packages</a></p>
<p><em>Method 1</em> (R graphical user interface for Windows):</p>
<p>Open R graphical user interface for Windows. Click on the ‘Packages’-menu and select ‘Install package(s) from local zip file…’. Select the package <code>.zip</code> binary package that you just downloaded, so that it is installed.</p>
<p>When done, type</p>
<pre><code>library("codeinfo)
library("macroutils2")
library("rmacrolite")
library("macrounchained")</code></pre>
<p>to check if the installation was successful.</p>
<p><em>Method 2</em> (install the zip binary package using the command line):</p>
<p>Open R command line prompt or R graphical user interface for Windows and type:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages( 
    pkgs = "C:/path/to/binary/file/codeinfo_x.y.z.zip", 
    repos = NULL ) 
install.packages( 
    pkgs = "C:/path/to/binary/file/macroutils2_x.y.z.zip", 
    repos = NULL ) 
install.packages(

    repos = NULL ) 
install.packages( 
    pkgs = "C:/path/to/binary/file/macrounchained_x.y.z.zip", 
    repos = NULL ) </code></pre>
<p>where <code>C:/path/to/binary/file/</code> should be replaced by the actual path to the folder where the binary package was downloaded and <code>codeinfo_x.y.z.zip</code>, <code>macroutils2_x.y.z.zip</code>, <code>rmacrolite_x.y.z.zip</code> and <code>macrounchained_x.y.z.zip</code> by the actual file-names (<code>x.y.z</code> being the version number, different for different packages). It is important to use a slash (<code>/</code>) as path separator, or alternatively a double backslash (<code>\\</code>), instead of a single backslash (<code>\</code>; Windows standard), as the later is a reserved character in R.</p>
<p><em>Method 3</em> (install the source package using the command line:</p>
<p>Open R command line prompt or R graphical user interface for Windows and type:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages( 
    pkgs = "C:/path/to/source/file/codeinfo_x.y.z.tar.gz",

<p>This method is reserved for experienced R users and developers. If you don’t know what you are doing, choose one of the installation method above.</p>
<p>The development version of <code>macroutils2</code> is publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub development platform">GitHub</a> (<a href="https://github.com/julienmoeys/macroutils2" title="R package macroutils2 (GitHub)">here</a>), as well as the development version of <code>rmacrolite</code> (<a href="https://github.com/julienmoeys/rmacrolite" title="R package rmacrolite (GitHub)">here</a>) and <code>codeinfo</code> (<a href="https://github.com/julienmoeys/codeinfo" title="R package codeinfo (GitHub)">here</a>),</p>
<p>to install the development version of the packages, you will need to install the package <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools" title="R package devtools (CRAN)">devtools</a> first. It is available on CRAN and can be easily installed. Simply type <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/topics/install.packages">install.packages("devtools")</a></code> in R command prompt. See also the package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/readme/README.html">README</a> page.</p>
<p>You can then install the development version of <code>codeinfo</code>, <code>macroutils2</code> and <code>rmacrolite</code> by typing in R command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>devtools::install_github("julienmoeys/codeinfo")
devtools::install_github("julienmoeys/macroutils2")
devtools::install_github("julienmoeys/rmacrolite")

<a href="#source-the-package-as-an-r-script-instead-of-installing-the-package" class="anchor"></a>Source the package as an R script instead of installing the package</h2>
<p>It is also possible to source the package as an R-script instead of installing the package. This method has some drawbacks (help pages not available; R workspace polluted with many objects otherwise invisible to end-users; sourced-code may be accidentally modified by the user; lack of traceability), but may be useful to some users, for example with restricted possibilities to install new R packages, as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping">bootstrap</a>.</p>
<p>First, open the following <code>.r</code>-file <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained/master/R/macrounchained.r" class="uri">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained/master/R/macrounchained.r</a> and save it on your computer. This file contains the full R source code of the package.</p>
<p>Open R command line prompt or R graphical user interface for Windows and type:</p>
<pre><code>library("codeinfo") 
library("macroutils2") 
library("rmacrolite") 
source( "C:/path/to/file/macrounchained.r" ) </code></pre>

<a href="#swedish-and-norwegian-macro-scenario" class="anchor"></a>Swedish and Norwegian MACRO scenario</h2>
<p>The five Swedish and Norwegian MACRO scenario (Krusenberg, Önnestad, Näsbygård, Heia and Rustad) require specific climate-files that are not delivered with MACRO In FOCUS. These files are not included either in <code>macrounchained</code>, and need to be obtained separately. See the Northern Zone Guidance Document for more information.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is not necessary to have the Access database with the Norwegian MACRO scenario (Heia and Rustad), as their parameters are included in <code>macrounchained</code>. More generally, <code>macrounchained</code> does not make use of MACRO In FOCUS Access-files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="benchmarks" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#benchmarks" class="anchor"></a>Benchmarks</h1>
<p>In order to make sure that the package results are conform to the output of MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4 or MACRO 5.2, a number of benchmarks have been prepared. In these benchmarks, the output of <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> is compared to the output of MACRO In FOCUS (PECgw and water percolation).</p>
<p>These benchmarks can be run at anytime, and also aim at detecting mistakes that could be introduced in the code when it is further develloped (for maintenance or new features).</p>
<p>In some cases it is was possible to compare the output of <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> with MACRO In FOCUS (secondary metabolites), and the benchmarks is only used to detect accidental drift from the original output.</p>
<p>In these benchmarks, the parameter files (<code>.par</code>-files) produced by <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> or <code><a href="reference/macrounchained-methods.html">macrounchained()</a></code> are compared to those produced by MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4 or MACRO 5.2. Some differences in the parameter files have been noticed, that are thought to be without consequences on the output. The benchmark make sure there are no more differences than what is expected.</p>
<p>For reasons that are not completely clear, some small differences have been noted in the output files. They could be due to a difference in the preparation of the <code>indump.tmp</code>-file produced by MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4 or MACRO 5.2 and that produced by the <code>exeparfile.exe</code>. Small differences may also be possible in the way the results are aggregated for each “period” (yearly flows when the pesticide is applied every year). In the benchmarks, the PECgw produced by <code><a href="reference/macrounchainedFocusGW-methods.html">macrounchainedFocusGW()</a></code> are the same as those produced by MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4, when rounded to three significant figures, but a case has been observed where the third digit of the PECgw differed from that of MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4. In the later case, it was observed that several years had very close yearly-average concentrations, resulting in a different ranking that that obtained by MACRO In FOCUS 5.5.4.</p>
<p>The benchmarks and their results are available here <a href="https://github.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained/tree/master/inst/more_tests" class="uri">https://github.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained/tree/master/inst/more_tests</a></p>
