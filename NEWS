CHANGES IN VERSION 0.11.1
    
    2019/04/11  The output for the two norwegian scenario 
        is not set to target layer instead of the lower 
        boundary. For the simulation tested it hardly 
        changes the results.
        
        A bug fix in rmacroliteInfo() is propagated 
        to this package. It occurred when running 
        MACRO 5.2 simulations.
        
        The operation log now indicates if the scenario 
        is a FOCUS scenario or not.
        
    2019/04/16  Added a new benchmark test for MACRO 5.2 
        (additional tests not run during compilation), 
        including a parent and a primary metabolite.
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.11.0
    
    2019/03/26  Add the two Norwegian groundwater scenario 
        Rustad and Heia. Adapt the code so that it also can 
        handle scenario where the PECgw is calculated from 
        the lower boundary.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.10.1
    
    2019/03/22  Fix various bugs in crop parametrisation revealed 
        while testing the Swedish GW scenario.
        
        Add a test for Swedish groundwater scenario.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.10.0
    
    2019/03/15  Start implementing user input of FOCUS-scenario 
        and FOCUS-crop rather than the user providing a template 
        parameter file for their MACRO In FOCUS simulations.
    
    2019/03/16  Implementation finished, but not fully tested.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.3
    
    2019/03/03  macrounchained() now has and 
        argument focus_mode, that can be set to "gw" to 
        use improvements in rmacrolite::rmacroliteApplications()
        and rmacrolite::rmacroliteInfo() to modify automatically 
        the par-file for the right number of applications per 
        application years and the right number of years 
        interval between applications. 
        
        macrounchainedFocusGW() now use this option internally.
        As a consequence, the user now just need a template
        par-file with the right scenario and crop. The rest 
        is accounted for internally.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.2
    
    2019/02/15  The first version of the package vignette 
        is now ready (macrounchainedfocusgw-manual.Rmd) 
        and added to the version control.
        
        A package site is create with pkgdown and added 
        to the version control (not shipped with the 
        package)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.1
    
    2019/02/05  macrounchained() now indicates 
        explicitly when the indump.tmp generation or 
        the simulation is skipped in the operation log.
        
        Changed path separator in .muc_anonymisePath()
        
    2019/02/11  .muc_anonymisePath() now also justify paths 
        to avoid Pandoc crashing when processing a vignette 
        with a long path in the output.
        
    2019/02/13  As the crash may be caused by a long file name, 
        trials and errors to avoid Pandoc to crash.
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.0
    
    2018/12/10  First build of the package
    
    2019/01/10  First commit in git repository
